Abstract methods:
----------------
Abstract methods defined in an interface must be overridden by any class that implements that interface.

Default Method:
---------------
Introduced in Java 8.
Provides a default implementation within the interface itself.
Can be overridden by classes implementing the interface.
Intended primarily for backward compatibility and adding new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

Concrete Method:
----------------
Introduced in Java 9.
Provides a complete implementation within the interface itself.
Cannot be overridden by implementing classes.
Mainly used to prevent code duplication across multiple default methods within the same interface.

Note: Default methods can be overridden, while concrete methods cannot.
